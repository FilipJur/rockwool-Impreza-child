## User Registration System

### **Architecture Overview**
The registration system implements a secure three-stage approval process:

```
Guest → [SMS OTP] → Prospect → [Form Submission] → Awaiting Review → [Admin Approval] → Full Member
```

### **Key Components**
- **`src/App/Users/Manager.php`**: Main orchestrator with singleton pattern
- **`src/App/Users/RegistrationHooks.php`**: Handles OTP registration and CF7 form processing
- **`src/App/Users/RoleManager.php`**: Custom role management (`pending_approval`, `full_member`)
- **`src/App/Services/UserService.php`**: Status checking and permission logic

### **Critical Implementation Details**

#### **AJAX Session Handling**
Contact Form 7 AJAX submissions can lose session context. The system includes cookie fallback:
```php
// In RegistrationHooks::handle_final_registration_submission()
if (!$user_id && isset($_COOKIE[LOGGED_IN_COOKIE])) {
    $cookie_elements = wp_parse_auth_cookie($_COOKIE[LOGGED_IN_COOKIE], 'logged_in');
    // Extract user from cookie...
}
```

#### **Form Configuration**
- **Form ID**: 292 ("Final registrace")
- **Configuration**: Set in `src/bootstrap.php` via `$users_manager->set_registration_form_id(292)`
- **Hook**: `wpcf7_mail_sent` action for form processing

#### **Role Transitions**
1. **OTP Registration**: `user_register` → `pending_approval` role + `needs_form` status
2. **Form Submission**: CF7 submission → `awaiting_review` status (role unchanged)
3. **Admin Approval**: Manual promotion → `full_member` role + meta cleared

### **Testing Considerations**
- ⚠️ **Incognito Mode**: May cause session issues - test in regular browser tabs
- ✅ **Cookie Fallback**: Handles AJAX session loss automatically
- ✅ **Role Verification**: System blocks purchases for pending users

## Development Patterns

### **When Working with Users Domain**
1. **Always use the Manager singleton**: `\MistrFachman\Users\Manager::get_instance()`
2. **Status checks via UserService**: `$user_service->get_user_registration_status($user_id)`
3. **Role checks via RoleManager**: `$role_manager->is_pending_user($user_id)`

### **Adding New User Features**
1. Add business logic to appropriate domain class
2. Update UserService for status/permission checks
3. Add hooks in RegistrationHooks if needed
4. Test with different user states: logged out, pending, full member

### **Debugging User Issues**
- Check logs for `[USERS:*]` entries
- Verify user meta: `_mistr_fachman_registration_status`
- Confirm roles: `pending_approval` vs `full_member`
- Test AJAX submissions in non-incognito browsers

## Code Quality Standards

### **Namespace Requirements**
- Users domain: `MistrFachman\Users\*`
- Services: `MistrFachman\Services\*`
- Shortcodes: `MistrFachman\Shortcodes\*`
- E-Commerce: `MistrFachman\MyCred\ECommerce\*`

### **Dependency Injection**
- Use constructor injection for all dependencies
- Get services from Manager singletons: `$users_manager->get_user_service()`
- No direct instantiation of services in business logic

### **Error Handling**
- Use `mycred_debug()` for all logging with appropriate levels
- Include context data in all log entries
- Fail gracefully during API requests or when services unavailable

## Security Considerations

### **Admin Actions**
- All admin actions use WordPress nonces
- User promotion requires `edit_users` capability
- Secure redirect after admin actions

### **Form Processing**
- Sanitize all form inputs
- Verify user permissions before processing
- Log all registration state changes

## Performance Notes

### **Caching Strategy**
- User status checks are not cached (real-time accuracy required)
- Balance calculations include performance logging
- Shortcode registration uses auto-discovery pattern

### **Database Queries**
- User meta queries are optimized for single reads
- Role checks use WordPress native functions
- Avoid N+1 queries in user status checks

## Current Focus
WordPress child theme development with enterprise-grade architecture. **REGISTRATION SYSTEM COMPLETE** - Three-stage user registration flow fully functional with SMS OTP, Contact Form 7 integration, and admin approval workflow. System ready for production deployment and advanced feature development.

## Active Decisions
- **PSR-4 autoloading for entire codebase**: Composer autoloader replaces all manual require_once statements
- **Domain-driven architecture**: Code organized by business domain (ECommerce, Shortcodes) not implementation features
- **Component-based shortcodes**: React/Next.js-style reusable components with data injection and templating
- **Auto-discovery pattern**: Shortcodes automatically registered by scanning directory structure
- **Cart-aware balance calculation**: available = balance - cart_total replaces individual product checking (Single Source of Truth)
- **Context-aware purchasability**: Shop pages check can_afford_product(), cart/checkout/API pages check cart_total <= user_balance
- **Namespaced classes**: `MistrFachman\MyCred\ECommerce\Manager` replaces `MyCred_Pricing_Manager`
- **Single bootstrap file**: One require_once for autoloader, eliminates dependency management complexity
- **Use functional patterns over classes**: Classes only for stateful components (FileUpload singleton), functions for everything else
- **Proper cleanup required**: All setup functions must return cleanup methods, all classes must implement destroy/cleanup
- **Avoid View Transitions API**: Causes browser compatibility issues and animation conflicts - use CSS animations instead
- **NO INLINE STYLING IN SHORTCODES**: Shortcodes are functional smart components - styling is handled separately in SCSS/CSS files
- **Semantic CSS naming for shortcodes**: Wrapper elements include context classes (e.g., `filter-affordable`, `filter-unavailable`) for targeted styling
- **Inline template rendering over method abstraction**: Use `ob_start()`/`ob_get_clean()` for direct template output instead of complex method chains
- **Eliminate unnecessary abstraction layers**: Remove intermediate methods when they don't add value (e.g., `render_builtin_grid()`)
- **Simplify administrative features**: Remove complex admin documentation systems and permission checking that add boilerplate without business value
- **Domain-based code bundles**: Organize code analysis and documentation by business domains rather than technical file types
- **Bundle maintenance required**: Every new file created must be added to appropriate Repomix bundle for code organization and analysis

## Bundle Management Protocol

### Repomix Bundle Maintenance
- **MANDATORY**: When creating any new file, immediately add it to the appropriate bundle in `.repomix/bundles.json`
- **Domain-based organization**: Group files by business domain (ECommerce, Shortcodes, etc.) not technical type
- **Comprehensive coverage**: The `app-comprehensive` bundle contains the complete `src/App/` directory for full architecture analysis
- **Bundle updates**: Update `lastUsed` timestamp when modifying files within a bundle
- **New domains**: Create new bundles for new business domains or major features

# 🧩 Global AI‑Agent Coding Guidelines

## 0. Stepped Delivery
1. **Make it work.** Deliver a correct, end-to-end solution.
2. **Make it right.** Refactor for clarity, maintainability, and correctness.
3. **Make it fast.** Optimize performance only after functionality and readability are verified.

## 1. Code Architecture
- Split logic into **small, reusable modules**.
- **Threshold:** If a file exceeds 200 lines or mixes responsibilities, suggest splitting it.
- Organize code by **feature or concern**, not just by file type.
- Favor **composition over duplication**.

## 2. Commits & Version Control
- **Always ask**: “Has this been tested and verified?”
- **Do not commit** without explicit user confirmation.
- Use a **feature-branch** workflow (no direct commits to `main`).
- Write clear, structured commit messages using prefixes like `[feat]`, `[fix]`, `[refactor]`, `[docs]`, `[style]`, `[chore]`, `[test]`, or `[update]`.
- **NEVER INCLUDE**: Rovo attribution messages, co-authored-by messages, or generated-with messages in commits.
- Keep commit messages short and focused on the change — no names, emails, or vague labels.
- Use `[refactor]` only for major architectural changes. Use `[update]` for improvements and simplifications.
- Commit only stable, verified changes. Favor small, frequent commits when possible.

## 3. Decision‑Making & Feedback
- **Don’t say “yes” blindly** — push back on unrealistic or poorly thought-out requests.
- Always be polite and constructive: offer simpler alternatives or ask clarifying questions.
- Prioritize **clarity**, **maintainability**, and **future readability**.
- If unsure, **ask before acting**.

## 4. “If‑Then” Enforcement
- **If** file >200 lines or has mixed concerns → **Then** suggest splitting into modules.
- **If** user says “commit it” → **Then** ask: “Are tests/builds passing and verified?”
- **If** a request seems ambiguous or over-engineered → **Then** ask questions or offer a simpler approach.

## 5. Living Memory Management

### Memory Structure Enforcement
- **If** project .agent.md missing → **Then** create with sections: Current Focus, Recent Changes, Active Decisions, Known Issues, Last Updated
- **If** existing .agent.md lacks sections → **Then** append missing sections with current date

### Session Management
- **If** starting work session → **Then** read Current Focus, ask "Is this still accurate?"
- **If** Current Focus changed → **Then** move old focus to Recent Changes with timestamp
- **If** session ending after significant work → **Then** update Current Focus and Recent Changes

### Decision Tracking
- **If** making architectural choice → **Then** log in Active Decisions with rationale and date
- **If** rejecting an approach → **Then** log why rejected in Active Decisions
- **If** Active Decisions entry >6 months old → **Then** ask "Is this decision still valid?"

### Issue Management
- **If** encountering blocker → **Then** add to Known Issues with date and context
- **If** resolving Known Issue → **Then** move to Recent Changes as "Resolved: [issue]"
- **If** Known Issue >30 days old → **Then** ask "Is this still blocking progress?"

### Memory Maintenance
- **If** Recent Changes >10 entries → **Then** archive oldest 5 to separate "Archive" section
- **If** any section unchanged >60 days → **Then** ask "Should we review/update this section?"
- **If** Last Updated >14 days old → **Then** prompt for memory review
