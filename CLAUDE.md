## Recent Changes
- **2025-06-27**: [fix] FAKTURY ACF FIELD POPULATION RESOLVED - Fixed ACF field population issue for Faktury domain. Points now display correctly in both admin dashboard and post edit screens. Complete Faktury domain now fully production-ready with no remaining blockers.
- **2025-06-27**: [maintenance] COMPREHENSIVE BUNDLE AUDIT - Audited all .repomix bundles for accuracy against current codebase structure. Removed obsolete file references (domain-specific StatusManager/AdminAssetManager files consolidated into Services). Added missing DebugLogger.php to Services bundles. Fixed duplicate template references. Ensured full-stack-architecture bundle has complete coverage: all 59 PHP files in src/App/, all 20 JavaScript files in src/js/, all template files, key integration files (CLAUDE.md, functions.php, etc.). No SCSS files correctly excluded. All bundles now accurately reflect consolidated services architecture.
- **2025-06-26**: [chore] BUNDLE MANAGEMENT CLEANUP - Updated .repomix/bundles.json to remove deleted StatusDropdownManager.js references from all bundles. Added Services directory files (StatusManager.php, AdminAssetManager.php) to base-architecture and full-stack-architecture bundles. Updated lastUsed timestamps for affected bundles to maintain accurate project state tracking.
- **2025-06-26**: [feature] DEDICATED REJECT/REVOKE BUTTON SYSTEM COMPLETE - Revolutionary UX improvement replacing problematic status dropdown with context-aware button system. Three distinct states: pending posts show red "Odm√≠tnout" button, published posts show orange "Zru≈°it schv√°len√≠" button, rejected posts show grey "Odm√≠tnuto" disabled button. Fixed critical AJAX action bug (window.pagenow ‚Üí window.typenow). Enhanced confirmation dialogs with context-appropriate messages. Integrated StatusManager to add "Odm√≠tnuto" option to WordPress native dropdown. Completely removed StatusDropdownManager.js and related PHP localization code. System eliminates validation gatekeeper conflicts and provides intuitive admin workflow.
- **2025-06-26**: [cleanup] DEBUG LOGGING REMOVAL - Cleaned up debug logging from ValidationService to prepare for production deployment. Removed verbose logging statements while maintaining error handling and critical debugging information.
- **2025-07-01**: [docs] INVOICE POINTS CALCULATION DOCUMENTATION - Updated CLAUDE.md documentation to reflect actual implementation of floor(value/10) formula for Faktury points calculation. Business rule: 10 CZK = 1 point. Documentation now accurately matches the production codebase implementation in PointsHandler.php.
- **2025-06-26**: [feature] INVOICE PRE-PUBLISH DATE VALIDATION - Implemented comprehensive date validation for Faktury domain requiring invoices to be from current year only. Enhanced ValidationService with isDateValid() method supporting both Ymd and Y-m-d date formats. Validation integrates with AdminController pre-publish gatekeeper to prevent invalid invoice submissions. Business rule enforces current year restriction for invoice dates.
- **2025-06-26**: [fix] AJAX PARAMETER FORMAT SUPPORT - Enhanced AdminControllerBase to support multiple AJAX parameter naming conventions. Added backward compatibility for both legacy parameters (realizace_action) and new format ({post_type}_action). Improved parameter detection with fallback chain supporting domain-specific action parameters. Eliminates AJAX 403 errors from parameter format mismatches.

- **2025-06-25**: [refactor] ENGLISH SLUG MIGRATION COMPLETE - Successfully completed 3-phase refactoring to eliminate Czech language complexity. Updated 40+ files across PHP backend and JavaScript frontend to use English post types ('realization', 'invoice'). Removed DomainRegistry system entirely, replacing with direct string concatenation. All FieldService classes use English field names, all Management classes return English post types, and AJAX endpoints are perfectly aligned. System now uses predictable patterns: getPostType() returns English, WordPress post type remains Czech for URL compatibility. Zero AJAX 403 errors, simplified maintenance, future-proof architecture.
- **2025-06-25**: [fix] STATUS DROPDOWN TIMING FIX - Fixed missing "Odm√≠tnuto" status option in realizace post edit dropdowns by resolving script localization timing issue. Changed from admin_footer-post.php to admin_enqueue_scripts hook with priority 20 to ensure wp_localize_script runs before JavaScript execution. Fixed script enqueuing from wp_register_script to wp_enqueue_script in functions.php. StatusDropdownManager.js now properly initializes with mistrFachmanStatusDropdown configuration object. Cleaned up debug logging from production code.
- **2025-06-25**: [refactor] COMPLETE DOMAIN ABSTRACTION - Created StatusManagerBase (210 lines) and AdminAssetManagerBase (165 lines) for reusable domain patterns.

## User Registration System

### **Complete Three-Stage Registration Flow** ‚úÖ
1. **Stage 1: Guest ‚Üí Prospect (Automated)**
   - User registers via SMS OTP on `/prihlaseni` page
   - System assigns `pending_approval` role + `needs_form` meta status
   - User can browse products but cannot purchase

2. **Stage 2: Form Submission (Automated)**
   - Logged-in pending user submits Contact Form 7 (ID 292)
   - System auto-updates meta status to `awaiting_review`
   - Role remains `pending_approval` - no manual validation required

3. **Stage 3: Admin Approval (Manual)**
   - Admin reviews form submission via email notification
   - Admin promotes user via WordPress dashboard button
   - User role changes to `full_member` with full e-commerce access

### **Technical Implementation**
- **AJAX Session Handling**: Cookie fallback for Contact Form 7 submissions via UserDetectionService
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Pending users blocked from purchasing
- **Cart-Aware Balance System**: Prevents overcommitment during approval process
- **Admin Interface**: One-click promotion with security nonces
- **Modular Architecture**: Extracted services for user detection, status management, and configuration
- **Single Source of Truth**: Centralized constants and configuration classes

## Centralized Field Access System

### **RealizaceFieldService - Single Source of Truth** ‚úÖ
**Location**: `src/App/Realizace/RealizaceFieldService.php`

**Pattern**: All ACF field access must use centralized service methods:
```php
// CORRECT - Use centralized service with English field names
$points = RealizaceFieldService::getPoints($post_id);
$reason = RealizaceFieldService::getRejectionReason($post_id);
RealizaceFieldService::setPoints($post_id, 2500);

// INCORRECT - Never use hardcoded field names (old Czech patterns)
$points = get_field('sprava_a_hodnoceni_realizace_pridelene_body', $post_id);
update_field('realizace_duvod_zamitnuti', $reason, $post_id);
```

**Benefits**:
- **Field name changes**: Update only in RealizaceFieldService constants
- **Type safety**: Consistent return types and validation
- **ACF/meta fallback**: Automatic graceful degradation
- **Future domains**: Copy pattern for Faktury, Certifikace, etc.

**Architecture**: Abstract base classes delegate to field service for true abstraction without hardcoded dependencies.

### **Manual Validation Commands** ‚ö°
Quick architecture compliance checks:
```bash
# Check all patterns at once
./scripts/validate.sh

# Individual checks
./scripts/validate.sh field-service    # ACF field access compliance
./scripts/validate.sh file-size        # File size warnings (>350 lines)
./scripts/validate.sh domain-boundaries # Cross-domain coupling detection
```

**Usage**: Run before major commits or when reviewing architecture changes. Simple, reliable validation without complex hook dependencies.

## Active Decisions
- **Dedicated reject button system** (2025-06-26): PRODUCTION-READY SOLUTION - Eliminated problematic status dropdown with context-aware button system in post editor publish box. Three distinct states: pending posts (red "Odm√≠tnout"), published posts (orange "Zru≈°it schv√°len√≠"), rejected posts (grey "Odm√≠tnuto" disabled). Integrates with WordPress native dropdown via StatusManager JavaScript injection. Eliminates validation gatekeeper conflicts, provides intuitive admin workflow, and resolves all AJAX timing issues. StatusDropdownManager.js completely removed in favor of unified AdminControllerBase implementation.
- **Consolidated services architecture** (2025-06-26): UNIFIED SERVICE PATTERN - Created configurable Services/StatusManager.php and Services/AdminAssetManager.php eliminating domain-specific service duplication. Services accept configuration arrays enabling full customization while sharing core functionality. Reduced 6 domain-specific files to 2 reusable services. Established pattern for rapid domain scaling with zero code duplication. Services integrate seamlessly with existing base class architecture.
- **Faktury domain implementation** (2025-06-26): COMPLETE PRODUCTION ARCHITECTURE - Full invoice management domain with dynamic points calculation (floor(value/10)), comprehensive ValidationService with date validation, form integration, and admin interface. Complete domain architecture established: Manager, AdminController, PointsHandler, ValidationService, FakturaFieldService, FormHandler. Business rules implemented for current-year date validation. ACF field population issue resolved - fully production ready.
- **English slug architecture** (2025-06-25): FINAL ARCHITECTURE - Eliminated DomainRegistry complexity entirely. All PHP classes return English post types ('realization', 'invoice'), JavaScript uses English slugs, AJAX endpoints use direct string concatenation. WordPress post type slugs remain Czech ('realizace', 'faktura') for URL compatibility. FieldService classes use English field names (points_assigned, rejection_reason). System achieved perfect PHP/JavaScript alignment with zero AJAX 403 errors. Predictable, maintainable, future-proof architecture.
- **Complete domain abstraction** (2025-06-25): Created StatusManagerBase and AdminAssetManagerBase for true cross-domain reusability. Integrated StatusDropdownManager.js into webpack build system with clean AdminApp module initialization. Enhanced AdminControllerBase with users table integration. Achieved 30% overall code reduction while establishing patterns for rapid Faktury implementation. JavaScript system now fully generic and configuration-driven.
- **Template system architecture** (2025-06-25): Complete MVC separation with template-based rendering for all admin cards - 84% code reduction with zero HTML in PHP classes. Template loading system enables rapid domain expansion with zero code duplication
- **Centralized field access**: All ACF field access through RealizaceFieldService - eliminates hardcoded field names and synchronization bugs
- **Enterprise architecture**: Domain-driven structure with PSR-4 autoloading and single bootstrap
- **Abstract base class architecture** (2025-06-23): Created PostTypeManagerBase, AdminControllerBase, PointsHandlerBase, and FormHandlerBase for domain abstraction. Enables rapid creation of new domains (Faktury, Certifikace) by extending proven patterns
- **Fixed default points system** (2025-06-23): Realizace awards fixed 2500 points with admin override capability. Single source of truth through ACF fields with automatic population. Simplifies admin workflow while maintaining flexibility
- **Functional JavaScript patterns**: setupFunction() approach for all feature modules with isolated state
- **Component-based shortcodes**: React-style reusable components with auto-discovery
- **Single Source of Truth**: Centralized balance calculation and status management
- **Direct dependency injection**: Eliminate unnecessary passthroughs, inject concrete dependencies
- **Tailwind CSS only**: No inline styling, semantic wrapper classes for targeted styling
- **Three-stage user approval**: Modular services with AJAX session handling via cookies
- **Living memory system**: CLAUDE.md hub with context-aware documentation triggers
- **Cohesive controllers over fragmentation** (2025-06-23): Single AdminController with clear responsibility sections instead of over-decomposed classes - line count is secondary to preventing mixed responsibilities and tight coupling
- **"No Debt" business policy** (2025-06-23): Point revocation never creates negative balances - revoke only up to current user balance to maintain financial integrity
- **Frontend-only Tailwind CSS** (2025-06-23): Tailwind CSS only loaded on frontend via wp_enqueue_scripts to prevent admin class conflicts with WordPress core
