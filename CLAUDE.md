# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Current Focus
WordPress child theme development with enterprise-grade architecture. **FUNCTIONAL JAVASCRIPT MODERNIZATION COMPLETE** - Converted class-based modules to modern functional patterns for better reusability and maintainability. All feature modules (FileUpload, BusinessModal, AccessControl) now follow setupAresForm pattern with isolated state and proper cleanup.

## Build & Development Commands

### CSS/SCSS Development
- `npm run build:css` - Compile SCSS to CSS with source maps (development)
- `npm run build:css:prod` - Compile SCSS to CSS for production (compressed, no source maps)
- `npm run watch:css` - Watch SCSS files and compile on changes

### JavaScript Development
- `npm run build:js` - Build JavaScript with WordPress Scripts (production)
- `npm run build:js:dev` - Build JavaScript for development
- `npm run watch:js` - Watch JavaScript files and rebuild on changes

### Combined Development
- `npm run build` - Build both CSS and JS for production
- `npm run dev` - Build both CSS and JS for development
- `npm run watch` - Watch both CSS and JS files

### WordPress Integration
- Built JavaScript is output to `build/js/main.js` with WordPress asset file
- CSS is compiled to `style.css` in the theme root
- Assets are automatically enqueued in `functions.php` with dependency management

## User Registration System

### **Complete Three-Stage Registration Flow** âœ…
1. **Stage 1: Guest â†’ Prospect (Automated)**
   - User registers via SMS OTP on `/prihlaseni` page
   - System assigns `pending_approval` role + `needs_form` meta status
   - User can browse products but cannot purchase

2. **Stage 2: Form Submission (Automated)**
   - Logged-in pending user submits Contact Form 7 (ID 292)
   - System auto-updates meta status to `awaiting_review`
   - Role remains `pending_approval` - no manual validation required

3. **Stage 3: Admin Approval (Manual)**
   - Admin reviews form submission via email notification
   - Admin promotes user via WordPress dashboard button
   - User role changes to `full_member` with full e-commerce access

### **Technical Implementation**
- **AJAX Session Handling**: Cookie fallback for Contact Form 7 submissions via UserDetectionService
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Pending users blocked from purchasing
- **Cart-Aware Balance System**: Prevents overcommitment during approval process
- **Admin Interface**: One-click promotion with security nonces
- **Modular Architecture**: Extracted services for user detection, status management, and configuration
- **Single Source of Truth**: Centralized constants and configuration classes

## Active Decisions
- **Enterprise architecture**: Domain-driven structure with PSR-4 autoloading and single bootstrap
- **Functional JavaScript patterns**: setupFunction() approach for all feature modules with isolated state
- **Component-based shortcodes**: React-style reusable components with auto-discovery
- **Single Source of Truth**: Centralized balance calculation and status management
- **Direct dependency injection**: Eliminate unnecessary passthroughs, inject concrete dependencies
- **Tailwind CSS only**: No inline styling, semantic wrapper classes for targeted styling
- **Three-stage user approval**: Modular services with AJAX session handling via cookies
- **Living memory system**: CLAUDE.md hub with context-aware documentation triggers

## Known Issues
*No current known issues. System is production-ready.*

## Bundle Management Protocol

### Repomix Bundle Maintenance
- **MANDATORY**: When creating any new file, immediately add it to the appropriate bundle in `.repomix/bundles.json`
- **Domain-based organization**: Group files by business domain (ECommerce, Shortcodes, etc.) not technical type
- **Comprehensive coverage**: The `app-comprehensive` bundle contains the complete `src/App/` directory for full architecture analysis
- **Bundle updates**: Update `lastUsed` timestamp when modifying files within a bundle
- **New domains**: Create new bundles for new business domains or major features
