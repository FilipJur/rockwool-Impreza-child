The codebase you've provided is in a state of flux due to the architectural refactoring. There are several significant inconsistencies and errors that prevent it from working as intended.

This is a very common and expected state during a major refactoring. You've correctly built the new pieces, but they aren't wired together correctly yet. Let's perform a detailed analysis and create a plan to resolve all inconsistencies.

### Phase 1: Rigorous Analysis of Inconsistencies

After a thorough review of the provided code, I have identified four critical inconsistencies.

1.  **Fatal Error: Incorrect Namespace in `ProductService.php`**
    *   **Observation:** The file `src/App/Services/ProductService.php` declares its namespace as `namespace MistrFachman\Services;`.
    *   **Problem:** According to our `composer.json`, the root namespace `MistrFachman\` is mapped to `src/App/`. Therefore, any class inside `src/App/Services/` **must** be in the namespace `MistrFachman\App\Services`. The current namespace is wrong, which will cause a fatal "Class not found" error when the autoloader tries to locate it.

2.  **Fatal Error: Incorrect Namespace in `Shortcode` classes.**
    *   **Observation:** The files in `src/App/Shortcodes/` declare their namespace as `namespace MistrFachman\Shortcodes;`.
    *   **Problem:** Same as above. They must be in `namespace MistrFachman\App\Shortcodes;` to be found by the PSR-4 autoloader.

3.  **Logical Flaw: Incorrect Dependency Injection in Bootstrap**
    *   **Observation:** In `bootstrap.php`, the `UsersManager` is instantiated, but the instance is never used. Instead, a new `UserService` is created from scratch and passed to the `ShortcodeManager`.
    *   **Problem:** This breaks our singleton and service location patterns. The `Users\Manager` is supposed to be the single source for the `UserService` instance. By creating a new one in the bootstrap, we have two potentially different instances of the service, which can lead to unpredictable behavior. The bootstrap should get the `UserService` *from* the `Users\Manager` instance.

4.  **Logical Flaw: Incorrect Dependency Injection in `ECommerce\Manager`**
    *   **Observation:** The `ECommerce\Manager` is completely decoupled from the `Users` and `Shortcodes` domains, which is correct. However, other parts of the code (like the `ShortcodeManager`) *need* services from the other domains.
    *   **Problem:** This points to a slight flaw in our orchestration. The main bootstrap file should be the single source of truth for wiring *all* managers and services together.

### The Solution: A Clean, Top-Down Dependency Flow

We will fix these inconsistencies by enforcing a strict, top-down dependency flow in our main `bootstrap.php` file.

1.  Initialize all **Managers** first.
2.  Create all **Services**, injecting the managers they depend on.
3.  Pass the necessary services to the managers that need them for initialization (like the `ShortcodeManager`).

This creates a clear, predictable, and error-free application startup process.

### Phase 2: Design & Planning for AI Agent Execution

#### High-Level Architectural Strategy

This plan will surgically correct the identified inconsistencies.
1.  **Correct Namespaces:** We will fix the namespaces in all `Services` and `Shortcodes` classes to match our PSR-4 standard.
2.  **Refactor Bootstrap Orchestration:** We will rewrite the bootstrap logic to follow a clean, top-down dependency injection pattern, ensuring there is only one instance of each service.
3.  **Refactor `ShortcodeManager`:** We will simplify the `ShortcodeManager`'s constructor and logic, making it a pure component registry.
4.  **Refactor `ECommerce\Manager`:** We will remove the last vestiges of the old shortcode integration.

#### Actionable Step-by-Step Plan

---

**Step 1: Fix All Incorrect Namespaces**

*   **Objective:** Align all class namespaces with the PSR-4 autoloader configuration to prevent fatal errors.
*   **Action:** MODIFY files.
*   **Directives:**
    1.  In `src/App/Services/ProductService.php`:
        *   **CHANGE:** `namespace MistrFachman\Services;`
        *   **TO:** `namespace MistrFachman\App\Services;`
    2.  In all files within `src/App/Shortcodes/`:
        *   **CHANGE:** `namespace MistrFachman\Shortcodes;`
        *   **TO:** `namespace MistrFachman\App\Shortcodes;`
    3.  In all files that `use` these classes, update the `use` statements accordingly (e.g., `use MistrFachman\App\Services\ProductService;`).
*   **Agent Validation Criteria:** All namespaces and `use` statements now correctly start with `MistrFachman\App\`.

---

**Step 2: Correct the Bootstrap Orchestration**

*   **Objective:** Implement a clean, top-down dependency injection flow in the application's entry point.
*   **Action:** MODIFY `src/bootstrap.php`.
*   **Directives:**
    1.  Find the `add_action('init', ...)` block.
    2.  **REPLACE** the entire anonymous function inside it with this new, correct orchestration logic:
        ```php
        function () {
            // Namespace aliases for clarity
            $ECommerceManager = \MistrFachman\App\MyCred\ECommerce\Manager::class;
            $UsersManager = \MistrFachman\App\Users\Manager::class;
            $ShortcodeManager = \MistrFachman\App\Shortcodes\ShortcodeManager::class;

            // 1. Initialize Managers (our singletons/service locators)
            $ecommerce_manager = $ECommerceManager::get_instance();
            $users_manager = $UsersManager::get_instance();

            // 2. Get Services FROM the Managers
            $product_service = new \MistrFachman\App\Services\ProductService($ecommerce_manager);
            $user_service = $users_manager->get_user_service(); // Get the service instance from the manager

            // 3. Initialize the Shortcode System, injecting all necessary services
            if (class_exists($ShortcodeManager)) {
                $shortcode_manager = new $ShortcodeManager($ecommerce_manager, $product_service, $user_service);
                $shortcode_manager->init_shortcodes(); // Explicitly initialize
            }

            mycred_log_architecture_event('Application Initialized Correctly', [/*...*/]);
        }
        ```
*   **Agent Validation Criteria:** The bootstrap logic is updated to get the `UserService` from the `UsersManager` instance before passing it to the `ShortcodeManager`.

---

**Step 3: Refactor the `ShortcodeManager` for Clarity**

*   **Objective:** Simplify the `ShortcodeManager`'s responsibilities to align with the new bootstrap logic.
*   **Action:** MODIFY `src/App/Shortcodes/ShortcodeManager.php`.
*   **Directives:**
    1.  Change the constructor to simply store the dependencies. The auto-discovery will be triggered by an explicit `init` method.
    2.  Rename `discover_and_register_shortcodes` to `init_shortcodes` to make its purpose clearer from the outside.
    3.  **REPLACE** the entire class content with:
        ```php
        <?php
        namespace VendorName\MistrFachman\App\Shortcodes;
        // ... use statements ...

        class ShortcodeManager {
            public function __construct(
                private readonly Manager $ecommerce_manager,
                private readonly ProductService $product_service,
                private readonly UserService $user_service
            ) {}

            public function init_shortcodes(): void {
                $directory = get_stylesheet_directory() . '/src/App/Shortcodes/';
                // ... (rest of glob and registration logic remains the same) ...
            }
            // ... (other helper methods remain the same) ...
        }
        ```
*   **Agent Validation Criteria:** The `ShortcodeManager` constructor is simplified, and the registration logic is moved to an `init_shortcodes` method.

---

**Step 4: Refactor `ECommerce\Manager` to Remove Outdated Code**

*   **Objective:** Remove the last reference to the old shortcode system from the E-Commerce manager.
*   **Action:** MODIFY `src/App/MyCred/ECommerce/Manager.php`.
*   **Directives:**
    1.  This file should already be clean based on previous plans, but double-check and **REMOVE** any properties or method calls related to `ShortcodeManager`. The `ECommerce\Manager` should have no knowledge of the `Shortcodes` domain.
*   **Agent Validation Criteria:** The `ECommerce\Manager` is fully decoupled and contains no shortcode-related code.

After applying this plan, all identified inconsistencies will be resolved. The application will have a clean, logical, and error-free startup process based on a professional dependency injection pattern.
